## Actions

Numerous actions are possible within the user interface. At any point, the available actions can usually be identified by the icons in one of the columns.

## Author-Title-Key \(ATS\)

This key is made up of the first four letters of the author’s surname and the first two letters of the ‘sort title’ \(i.e. the title used for sorting purposes\). It is used for books with a known author, e.g. monographs. If there is no author, the Title Key is used as the key instead.

## Content-based indexing

All images are marked with certain information and given a meaningful structure. This ‘indexing’ process involves allocating structure data, metadata and pagination data.

## Correction message

A red Correction message with a warning triangle is used to flag up an error or comment concerning a particular task to the preceding or following workstation. It indicates that the task needs to be processed again or reviewed. Correction messages appear automatically when the task list is displayed.

## Dialogue box

A predefined box that either has to be completed or already contains text that can be changed \(e.g. an input box with blank fields that need to be filled in\).

## Display

The way in which information is presented to the user. In the case of tables, for example, the number of columns may vary and can be partly configured by the user.

## Batch

This refers to a number of processes grouped together for batch processing.

## Bibliographical data

Data that describe a work in such a way that it cannot be mistaken for another, e.g. author, title, year of publication.

## Checkbox

This is a small box that can be clicked in order to set or remove a value \(e.g. yes/no\).

## Data export

This term is used when exporting data to another technical system \(e.g. the DMS\).

## Data import

This term is used when importing data from another technical system \(e.g. the DMS\).

## Derivative

A second version or copy of an image, i.e. not the original. While the image remains the same, properties such as the resolution, format and colour depth may have changed.

## Digitised material

Digitised form of a work \(e.g. images, full text and metadata\)

## DMS

Document Management System. This is a technical system in which the digitised material can be made available for public use together with the corresponding structure data and metadata.

## Element

Synonymous with structure element. Data is allocated to elements such as the publication type in order to structure a work.

## Filter

This option can be used when dealing with long lists of processes or tasks in order to search for particular words in a specified source work.

## Filter syntax

The option to search for different words in the specified source work. The search text can also be saved for later actions.

## Ficticious pagination

Each page is given a logical page number even if there is no page indication in the original work. This ‘assumed’ page number is written in square brackets.

## Free text field

A blank text field that can or in some cases \(i.e. where the information is required\) must be filled in.

## Header bar

This is a bar at the top of the Metadata Editor that allows users to choose from a range of important functions, e.g. a change of language, structural data, metadata and pagination.

## Icon

Another word for symbol, this is used in the context of an action that is performed by clicking on the icon/symbol.

## Image

In most digitisation contexts, this refers to the scanned image produced from the page of a source book.

## Image derivative

A copy of the image set. The resolution or format of the derivative is not the same as that of the original.

## Image display

Images are often displayed with browsing, search and zoom options.

## Image number

The number of the image file in the file system \(not the same as the printed page number\).

## Input box

A dialogue box or schema containing blank text fields that can be used to enter information.

## Master image

This is the original image as produced directly by the scanner with no subsequent modifications.

## Metadata

This is the term used for additional information about each individual structure element. Although some metadata may already be stored after importing from other library catalogues, in other cases the data may need to be entered manually in free text fields. The selection of available metadata depends on the configured ruleset.

## Metadata Editor

Synonym: METS Editor. This is a central component of Goobi. The user interface is designed to allow users to work with metadata, structure data and pagination data.

## METS

Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard. The file/container format in which metadata \(in MODS format\), structure data and other data can be stored together.

## METS Editor

Synonym: Metadata Editor

## MODS

Metadata Object Description Schema. The file format in which metadata can be stored.

## Page label

The printed page number, i.e. as shown in the original work.

## Pagination

The allocation of page labels to individual pages, i.e. using the page numbering in the original work.

## Pagination sequence

Different options for designating pages \(e.g. Roman or Arabic page numbers\)

## Pagination type

The way in which individual pages are numbered \(e.g. page numbering, sheet numbering, column numbering\)

## Process

A process consists of a number of tasks that are worked through in a specific order in order to comply with a uniform schema.

## Process template

Synonym for production template. The way a process is worked through can be used as a template for other processes. This relates not only to the sequence of tasks but primarily to the ruleset, which ensures that all tasks are performed in line with a uniform schema.

## Production template

A synonym for process template

## Ruleset

A set of rules specified by the administrator and used to define structure and metadata. Although some rulesets are predetermined, others can be freely configured and stored.

## Rotation

The option to rotate the displayed image. The corresponding icon is a curved arrow pointing left or right.

## Session

The time for which users remain automatically logged in, even though they may no longer be using the program. To prevent others from accessing the data and therefore avoid potential errors, the session length is limited. The default length of the session can be set by each user in the user configuration window. Once this time has expired, the user is automatically logged out.

## Shell command

An input field in which you can enter text-based commands to be executed immediately by the computer.

## Script

This is a file written in a script language, i.e. in a program code that is executed line by line and is not compiled. This means that users can perform a step within the Goobi workflow by calling an external program.

## Sort title

The title of a source work that is used for sorting purposes. It does not necessarily match the actual title of the work because it does not contain any \(in\)definite article or other special characters that might appear before the first word in the title.

## Status icon

The task list includes a column with a coloured square to indicate the current status of each task. The four status colours are green \(task completed\), yellow \(task in progress\), orange \(not yet accepted by a user\) and red \(task blocked\).

A bar with several colours is used to indicate the status of a process. The red section of the bar corresponds to tasks that have not yet been accepted. The yellow section indicates tasks that are in progress \(or waiting to be accepted\), while green is for those tasks that have already been completed.

## Structure data

The entire body of structure elements. Data in which the hierarchically recorded structure elements are stored.

## Structure element

One of a group of hierarchically organised categories that identify key elements within a source work, starting with the type of publication \(e.g. monograph\) and various sub-elements such as the foreword, chapter, introduction, afterword and glossary. Each sub-element may have its own sub-sub-elements. The idea is to reproduce the structure of the work as accurately as possible.

## Structure tree

This term is used to describe the tree-like hierarchy of structure elements.

## Sub-element

Structure elements can be divided into various sub-elements such as the foreword, content and an afterword. Each sub-element may have its own sub-sub-elements.

## Search box

Search boxes take the form of a template that allows users to enter one or more search terms. The layout is standardised, and the box appears whenever you perform a search.

## Search parameter

One or more keywords, PPN numbers or other details from the source work that can be used to perform a search.

## Symbol

Used to denote a concept, relationship, etc.

## Task

This term is synonymous with ‘workflow step’. A group of tasks is called a process. Individual users can access only those tasks which they have been authorised to perform.

## Task list

This is a list of all pending tasks that need to be carried out. They are listed on the basis of their priority. If necessary, they may be marked with a correction message.

## Text field

A blank field in which the user has to enter a text.

## Tif header

As a storage format, Tif needs additional information about size, colour depth, the image owner, etc. This information is stored in the Tif header.

## Title key \(TSL\)

The title key is made up as follows \(provided that the title contains more than four words\):  
The first four letters of the first word, the first two letters of the second word, the first two letters of the third word and the first letter of the fourth word.  
If the title contains fewer than four words, the corresponding letters are omitted. The title key is used for periodicals and series since there is no author.

## User configuration

This is the group of settings that determine how individual users can work with Goobi.

## Validation

Data entries, processes and workflow steps are validated to ensure that they are complete and observe the specified rules. An error message is generated in the event of an error or non-compliance with the rules.

## Web application

This is a program/application that is run via the internet and is therefore available to more than one user in different locations at the same time.

## Workflow

The workflow is a sequence of tasks that lead to a finished product if performed in the correct order. The job of a workflow management program is to provide detailed control of this sequence of tasks.

## Workflow management program

Goobi is a workflow management program. It is used to control and monitor production processes, from importing data and scanning through to digital presentations and other output in standard formats.

## Workflow step

A task \(e.g. scanning\) that is carried out manually or automatically at a specific time as part of the overall workflow for a given work station.

## Workstation

This term is used to describe the actual place \(e.g. scanning studio\) where a particular task \(e.g. scanning\) is performed.

## Zoom

Option to increase or reduce the size of the image currently being displayed. The corresponding icon is usually a magnifying glass.
