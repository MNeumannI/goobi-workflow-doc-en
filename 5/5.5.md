# 5.5. User groups

In order to ensure flexibility in the handling of freely configurable workflows and the corresponding users, you will need to define a number of user groups. These user groups can be understood as the roles, activities or skills of individual users within the workflow. By way of example, user groups can be created for scan operators, metadata editors and administrators. You are free to define these groups as you wish in Goobi and then assign individual users to them. To open the list of existing user groups, click on the menu item `Administration - User groups` in the menu. Goobi will display a list of all the user groups that have already been defined. For each of these user groups, you can also display a list of all the users assigned to that group. To show this list, simply click on the little symbol to the left of the user group name.

To create additional user groups, click on the Create new user group link. To edit existing user groups, however, you need to click on the Edit symbol in the Actions column.

| Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- |

| ![ruleset\_01.png](../.gitbook/assets/ruleset_01.png) | Edit existing user group |

The `Edit user group` dialogue box is very straightforward and only contains two values that you can configure. Firstly, you can give a freely definable name to the user group. Please ensure that the name is as meaningful as possible so that you and other administrators have a clear overview.

You will also need to specify an authorisation level for each defined user group. The latest version of Goobi distinguishes between three levels of authorisation:

## Basic user

`Basic user authorisation` merely allows users to access their own tasks and search for processes. Accordingly, such users can accept and close their own tasks, select or remove tasks from their list and \(on a read-only basis\) view existing processes in Goobi. They cannot access any other information in Goobi.

## Manager

As well as accessing their own tasks and searching for processes, users with `Manager` authorisation can also access production templates. They can make a selection from all the configured process templates stored in Goobi in order to generate new processes for those projects to which they have been assigned. `Manager` authorisation therefore allows users to create new processes based on configured workflows. Such users can also amend existing processes \(e.g. making changes to the process workflow\) and access the Metadata Editor directly, even if the user is not currently working on a process task that specifically requires the use of the Metadata Editor. In addition, users with Manager status can choose from the full range of functions available in process view in the `Actions` column and the `Possible actions` box.

## Administrator

As a Goobi `Administrator`, you have access to all Goobiâ€™s top-level user functions. In addition to the `Basic` user and `Manager` functions, you are authorised to make administrative changes in Goobi. As well as configuring rulesets, LDAP groups and projects, you can specify user groups and users and assign appropriate levels of authorisation. Since administrators have full access to all the functions offered by Goobi, this level of authorisation should be restricted to just a few users.
