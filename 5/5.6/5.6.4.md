# 5.6.4. GoobiScript

When you apply an action to a group of processes, you also have an option to run Goobi scripts within that action. To do so, click on the button `Execute GoobiScript` in the `Possible actions` box. Goobi will display an overview of all the scripts that can be applied to the entire list of processes, to the processes listed on the current page or just to a selection of processes.

For every GoobiScript, you need to enter the name of the script you wish to run as well as the corresponding parameters. These parameters are shown when you click on the script in the list. You will need to replace the parameters in capital letters with your own settings. Please note that parameters containing spaces \(e.g. the name of a step\) must be written inside quotation marks.

![List of available Goobi scripts](../../.gitbook/assets/77e.png)

You can choose from the following Goobi scripts:

## GoobiScript: addUser

The GoobiScript `addUser` allows you to add a new user to a specific workflow step. Before you apply this Goobi script, you should ensure that you have the correct login name for the user you wish to add to that step. You also need to check the exact name of the step to which you want to add a new user.

Please note that parameters containing spaces must be written inside quotation marks together with the parameter name and the dividing colon. For the parameter `steptitle` you should select the name of the step to which you want to add the new user.

## GoobiScript: addUserGroup

The GoobiScript `addUserGroup` is similar to `addUser`, as it gives additional user rights for workflow steps. For the parameter `steptitle`, enter the full name of the step to which you want to add a `user group`, and for the parameter entitled group enter the exact name of the user group you wish to add for that step.  
.

## GoobiScript: deleteTiffHeaderFile

For the GoobiScript `deleteTiffHeaderFile` there is no need to enter additional parameters. Running this GoobiScript will delete any previously created TIFF header files that can be used by a program that writes the TIFF headers into the images. This allows you, for example, to make centrally modified TIFF headers available for future use, since missing TIFF header files are automatically created on the basis of the configuration the next time the file is accessed.

## GoobiScript: swapSteps

The GoobiScript `swapSteps` allows you to swap the order of two steps within the workflow of a number of processes. To perform a swap, you need to provide the details of each of the steps involved. Enter the workflow number and full name of the first and second step. Running this script will then swap the order of the steps you have specified. This makes it very easy to change workflows across a large number of processes.

## GoobiScript: importFromFileSystem

The GoobiScript `importFromFileSystem` imports existing image sets from a defined output directory into processes that have already been created in Goobi. This can be useful if you want to import projects into Goobi that were created before Goobi was installed. Please note that all the image directories within the specified output directory must have the same name as the processes in Goobi. An automatic import from the file system can only be performed correctly if the folder name and process title are identical. For the parameter entitled `sourcefolder`, you need to specify the location of the individual directories containing the processes you wish to import.  
.

## GoobiScript: setRuleset

The GoobiScript `setRuleset` allows you to make a central change to the Goobi ruleset for a group of processes. This could be particularly important after detailed editing and testing of a ruleset \(for safety reasons this is performed separately in a newly created ruleset\), if you then wish to apply the new ruleset to the processes. For the parameter entitled `ruleset`, you need to specify the name of the ruleset using the name as it appears in the ruleset list in Goobi. The newly assigned ruleset will be entered when you run the GoobiScript, regardless of which ruleset is currently in place for the individual processes being changed.

## GoobiScript: deleteStep

You can run the GoobiScript `deleteStep` if you want to delete a specific step from the workflow for a group of processes. Running the script will delete the workflow step \(specified by its full name in the parameter `steptitle`\) from the list of selected processes. Please note that this GoobiScript will also delete any production-related data being stored for that particular workflow step \(e.g. project staff, processing date, status\).

## GoobiScript: addStep

The GoobiScript entitled `addStep` allows you to automatically create a new step with a specific name and a specific position in the workflow order. For the parameter `steptitle`, enter the name of the new step, and for the parameter `number` enter the required workflow order number.

## GoobiScript: setStepStatus

You can choose the GoobiScript `setStepStatus` to modify the workflow status for a group of processes at the same time. For the parameter `steptitle`, you need to enter the name of the workflow step whose status you wish to change. For the status `parameter`, you should enter the required numerical value using the system:

```text
0=locked
1=open
2=in progress
3=closed
4=error
5=deactivated
```

## GoobiScript: setStepNumber

Using the GoobiScript `setStepNumber` you can modify the workflow order number of an individual step for a group of processes. For the parameter `steptitle` you need to enter the full name of the workflow step you wish to change. For the `number` parameter you should enter the workflow order number you want to apply to that step for all the selected processes.

## GoobiScript: addShellScriptToStep

The GoobiScript `addShellScriptToStep` allows you to add shell scripts or other command-line calls to designated workflow steps in a group of processes. For the parameter `steptitle` you need to specify the full name of the steps you wish to change. For the `script` parameter, enter the full command that you wish Goobi to execute in the form of a command-line call whenever this step is activated.

Please note that shell commands at Linux level begin with `/bin/bash/`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If parameters are to be grouped in the command so that they are passed as an argument to the new process, the necessary quotation marks must be escaped with one preceding quotation mark each. An example would be the following GoobiScript:  
  
`action:addShellScriptToStep "steptitle:example_step" "label:testlabel" "script:/bin/bash /path/to/script.sh ""parameter with blanks"""`
{% endhint %}

## GoobiScript: setTaskProperty

You can use the Goobi script setTaskProperty to set individual options for a specific workflow step in a group of processes at the same time. For the parameter steptitle, you should enter the full name of the step you wish to select. For the propertyparameter, you will need to select one of the following values:

</table>You should also set the value of the actions you have specified here to activated or deactivated by entering the values `true` or `false` for the value parameter..

{% hint style="success" %}
**Sample:** For example, if you select `Scanning` as the `steptitle`, `writeimages` as the `property` and `true` as the `value` and apply this GoobiScript to a group of processes, this will allow a user who accepts the step entitled `Scanning` to have write access to the images in his/her working directory for that step.
{% endhint %}

## GoobiScript: export

The GoobiScript `export` allows you to export a large number of processes. The parameters `exportImages` and `exportOcr` can be used to specify whether the associated images and OCR data should be exported. If an export plugin has been configured in the workflow, that plugin will be loaded and used for the export; if not, Goobi will run the default export.

## GoobiScript: runScript

Using the GoobiScript `runScript`, you can initiate a script for a particular workflow step outside the regular workflow. The parameter `steptitle` is used to enter the full title of the workflow step whose scripts you wish to run.

If the workflow step contains a number of scripts, you can specify which one you wish to run using the `script` parameter. If this parameter is left blank, all the scripts for that workflow step will be run in the specified sequence.

## GoobiScript: deleteProcess

As the name suggests, the GoobiScript `deleteProcess` is used to delete processes. You can use the parameter `contentOnly` to specify whether Goobi should delete only the data from the file system or, additionally, all the information from the database. If this parameter is left blank, the process will be deleted completely.

## GoobiScript: updateMetadata

This GoobiScript allows you to update the internal metadata table in the Goobi database. This is important in cases where the metadata have been modified outside Goobi or a new index field has been defined.

## GoobiScript: addPluginToStep

The GoobiScript `addPluginToStep` allows you to add plugins to workflow steps. You can use the parameter `steptitle` to specify the name of the workflow step and the parameter `plugin` for the identifier of the plugin that you wish to add..
